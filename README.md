# Music_Store_Data_Analysis_Using_SQL
This SQL project presents an analysis of a music store's playlist database, providing insights into the store's business expansion. The study of this data will enhance our understanding of the store's growth trajectory in the music industry.
This project involves the creation and management of a music store database using SQL. The database is designed to store information about artists, albums, tracks, customers, and sales. It provides a structured way to manage and query the data efficiently.

## Database Schema

The database schema is designed to include the following tables:

- **Artists**: Stores information about music artists.
- **Albums**: Stores information about albums, linked to artists.
- **Tracks**: Stores information about individual tracks, linked to albums.
- **Customers**: Stores customer information.
- **Sales**: Records sales transactions, linking customers to purchased tracks.

## SQL Scripts

The project includes several SQL scripts:

- `create_tables.sql`: Script to create the database tables.
- `insert_data.sql`: Script to insert sample data into the tables.
- `queries.sql`: Script containing example queries to retrieve data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-store-sql.git
    cd music-store-sql
    ```

2. **Set up the database**:
    - Ensure you have a SQL server running (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    - Run the `create_tables.sql` script to create the tables.
    - Run the `insert_data.sql` script to insert sample data.

3. **Run Queries**:
    - Use the `queries.sql` script to run example queries and explore the data.
